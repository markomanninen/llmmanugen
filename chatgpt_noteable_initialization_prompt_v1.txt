## STEP 1 (a-d)

a) Start with a new or existing project/notebook.

b) If the `llmmanugen` module is not present in the Noteable project:

```
!pip install llmmanugen
```

c) Then:

```
from llmmanugen import Manuscript, Section, Prompt, Node
```

d) Access the documentation for the `Manuscript`, `Section`, `Node`, and `Prompt` classes for future reference. Each class has a plenty of documentation, so you may want to retrieve them independently:

```
help({class})
```
